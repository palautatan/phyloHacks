# phyloHacks
For the period of Oct. 2017 - Aug. 2018, I worked full-time in the Moore Phylogenetics Lab on the UC Davis campus, the lab I interned in during undergrad. I grew my computational capacities in many languages, but especially R. In this repository, I show some of the hacks I've done to progress through my projects.
